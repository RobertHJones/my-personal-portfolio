    info: "Having been a musician for most of my life (studying to Master's level), I spend a great deal of my time making music. I have performed at most of the major venues across the UK as well as many festivals, including Glastonbury and Boomtown. Similar to coding, music is all about creating with other people, and when you form a group really working together the results are incredible.",

    subject: "Yoga",
    info: " I can genuinely say that yoga has changed my life. I have been practising for over six years and now have a daily practice.Because of yoga I can do things that I thought would never be physically possible, but more importantly it has given me a sense of inner peace and tranquilty that always sees me through the hard times and enables me to put things in perspective. I mostly practice Ashtanga yoga and have a particular affinity for handstands, which I am starting to teach around the Birmingham area (watch this space!)",

It's remarkable what fantastic resources are out there available to everyone for free (this applies for coding too)",
